### end goal:

- person draws curve on 2d canvas
- rendered on the surface of a sphere
  - stereographic projection
- on submit, each point becomes a curve in 3D

### milestones:

1. take a nice set of 3D coordinates for one curve and hopf that shiiiit
  - be able to plot a parameterized curve
2. do this for multiple curves, each one with a distinct color gradient
3. create 2D canvas and let person draw on it
4. 2D canvas drawing to sphere
5. tie it all together
6. make it look good
